Question 1. Symbol Table Investigation
--------------------------------------

You will evaluate FIVE different Symbol Table implementations:

	* AVLTreeST
	* BST
	* LinearProbingHashST
	* SeparateChainingHashST
	* SequentialSearchST

You will need to modify your code to produce five tables that are assigned the labels:

    * Table I, Table II, Table III, Table IV, Table V

For this question, you must fill in:

	AVLTreeST               is Table II
	BST                     is Table IV
	LinearProbingHashST     is Table III
	SeparateChainingHashST  is Table V
	SequentialSearchST      is Table I
	
Finally, list these five structures (by name) in terms of which is MOST EFFICIENT 
in terms of HITS or MISSES for problems of size N=65536

1. LinearProbingHashST is the most efficient
2. SerparateChaininghashST
3. AVLTreeST
4. BST
5. SequentialSearchST is the least efficient
